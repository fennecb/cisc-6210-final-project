  "data": {
    "safety_score": 20.0,
    "reasoning": "Based on the menu data, Xi'an Famous Foods heavily features hand-ripped noodles in many of their dishes, which are a clear source of gluten. The menu items include 'Stewed Pork Hand-Ripped Noodles', 'Spicy Cumin Lamb Hand-Ripped Noodles In Soup', and 'Pork Zha Jiang Hand-Ripped Noodles.' The presence of 'Liang Pi Cold-Skin Noodles' *could* potentially be a safe option, but the data also includes 'Stir-Fried Liang Pi Cold-Skin Noodles,' introducing a cross-contamination risk. The restaurant is known for these noodle dishes, meaning there's a high likelihood of gluten flour being present throughout the kitchen. The menu includes 'GLUTEN-FREE' which is a positive sign, but given the numerous noodle dishes, and lack of more information about specific gluten-free practices at this location (e.g., dedicated preparation areas, utensils), the risk of cross-contamination is high. Furthermore, no positive indicators regarding dedicated preparation or staff knowledge were detected in the reviews.",
