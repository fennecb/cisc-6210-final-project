    "reasoning": "Sweetgreen generally offers many naturally gluten-free ingredients (salads, bowls) suitable for celiac disease. However, the menu explicitly lists items containing gluten: 'garlic breadcrumbs' (Buffalo Chicken), 'zaatar breadcrumbs' (Chicken Pesto Parm), and 'Rosemary Focaccia'. Breadcrumbs and focaccia pose a very high risk of cross-contact in a salad/bowl assembly line. No explicit gluten-free certification or dedicated preparation area is mentioned, relying solely on ingredient checks. The presence of multiple high-risk gluten items necessitates a moderate safety score.",
