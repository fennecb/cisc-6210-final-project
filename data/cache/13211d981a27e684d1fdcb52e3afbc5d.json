        "text": "Went to check out this location was excited about trying their caramelized steak bowl. When I arrived I was not greeted which made the atmosphere feel immediately not welcoming. I actually had to extend a hello before even being served I asked about the steak bowl the guy at front told me they didn\u2019t offer that. I looked up at the menu clearly seeing the option. He told me they would have to charge me more if I wanted that because it wasn\u2019t in the system. So of course I declined why would I pay more for something when the menu clearly says another price. So I opted for the kale Caesar chicken salad instead. As the girl started to prepare it, The kale looked old and wilted, they were down to the bottom of the barrel with the chicken. All I saw was liquid coming from the chicken as her coworker threw it on the salad. Did not look appetizing at all. So I declined for the food not only was the customer service terrible they tried charging me more for something and the food did not look fresh. Thanks but no thanks.",

        "text": "Unfortunately there is always an issue with an order at this location and tonight was no exception\u2026we ordered two dishes at around 8:15pm for pickup and when i just opened the steak dish, there was no broccoli and there was barely any dressing. I understand that things run out at the end of the day, but it would be courteous to tell the customer if they\u2019re out of something and if they\u2019d like another item as replacement. Now i\u2019ve paid for a full meal for not what i was expecting and it\u2019s too late to say anything because they\u2019re closed. It is unfortunate and this place continues to let the brand down.",

        "text": "I\u2019m writing this because management needs to know why this location is doomed to close, which is a shame because I like having a salad place close by. More than once I have had dirt in my salad. I\u2019m not talking about a little grit. Would take a few bites hoping it was a one-off but it really was inedible. I did receive a refund twice. This place is in my neighborhood so I thought maybe the issue would be resolved. However the last time the manager on duty literally admitted to me that they knew it was an issue and were trying to resolve it. Wait, you KNEW the lettuce was dirty and haven't figured out how to WASH it? I will NEVER EVER go back. Moms talk in town. People have had bugs in their salad (not roaches I will say but bugs). Hoping another better managed salad place will replace - like Chopt or Little Beet.",

This is actually very sad. Mind you, beautiful customer service was provided, this is the only thing that I had a problem with.\n\nLocation: Darien, CT",
