We strive to create classic Italian dishes using traditional techniques and a completely gluten-free approach. We are aware that having celiac disease and eating gluten-free can be challenging, especially when dining out, and we recognize the need for specific and rigorous safety policies. This is why our kitchen and dining rooms are strictly gluten-free. We hope that by creating a gluten-free environment we can help our guests feel comfortable, confident, and relaxed with their dining choice. If you have questions about our allergen policies please always feel free to email or call us directly. Our team would be happy to assist. We look forward to welcoming you to our restaurant.
