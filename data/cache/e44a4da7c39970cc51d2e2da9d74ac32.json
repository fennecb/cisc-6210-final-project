    "reasoning": "This is a standard American Chinese restaurant menu, which presents a very high inherent risk for celiac disease due to the near-universal use of wheat flour/soy sauce (containing wheat) in most dishes, preparation methods, and deep fryers. The menu data itself provides no specific gluten-free information, allergen matrices, or indications of dedicated preparation areas. Dishes like Egg Rolls, Fried Rice, Lo Mein, Chow Fun/Mei Fun, and most sauces (soy sauce) are presumptive gluten sources. The only items that might be inherently gluten-free are Plain Steamed Dishes (if ordered without sauces), White Rice, and beverages. The lack of any specific safety indicators or dedicated GF options suggests a high risk of cross-contact.",
