It was not edible. I called the restaurant and they put me through to the manager twice she did not respond left her a voicemail then I tried to call back third time and they blocked me. I will never order from here again.",

I couldn't taste anything else but massive corn Strach it was sooo thick much more than usual. Usually it's a light sauce. Was disappointed because I ordered for a large group who felt the same about their dishes who has never eaten here before.",
