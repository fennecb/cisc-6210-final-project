    "reasoning": "The menu is typical of a standard Americanized Chinese restaurant, which inherently carries a very high risk of gluten cross-contact and contamination. Most sauces (e.g., brown sauce, garlic sauce, Hunan sauce, Szechuan sauce, oyster sauce, soy sauce) in this cuisine almost always contain wheat/gluten unless explicitly stated otherwise. Many appetizers (Egg Rolls, Fried Wontons, Dumplings, etc.) use wheat-based wrappers and batter. Furthermore, the menu lacks any explicit mention of gluten-free preparation, dedicated fryers, or ingredient substitution options. The rule-based detector found no specific safety or warning indicators, which is common for a standard menu review, but it does not confirm safety.",
