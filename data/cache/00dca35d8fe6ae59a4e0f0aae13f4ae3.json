Simple yet perfect and sticky. Great for dipping in curry. I also want to thank the staff for serving me an hr before closing. I definitely recommend.",

        "text": "Absolutely loved our meal here! We were honestly surprised to see a few negative reviews, because our experience was the exact opposite. The food was flavorful, fresh, and plated beautifully. We ordered the shrimp pad Thai, crispy tofu with dipping sauces, papaya salad, and a savory beef stir-fry with rice\u2014and everything tasted homemade and authentic.\n\nThe portion sizes were more than fair, and for the quality, this place is actually one of the most affordable Thai spots we\u2019ve tried. You can see the care that goes into each dish. Even small things like the balance of veggies (yes, including tomatoes!) added to the flavors\u2014not just filler.\n\nService was friendly and the atmosphere felt cozy and welcoming. Whether you\u2019re dining in or thinking about takeout, don\u2019t let one negative review sway you. Give it a try\u2014we\u2019ll definitely be back!",
