The menu itself highlights certain 'Lifestyle Bowls' as gluten-free, which suggests some awareness. The OCR menu mentions flour tortillas, which pose a direct cross-contamination risk. Reviews do not offer any insights into safety practices or staff knowledge. There's insufficient evidence to confirm dedicated gluten-free preparation procedures.",
