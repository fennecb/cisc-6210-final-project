Several menu items contain gluten, including the Kale Caesar (parmesan crisps, caesar dressing *may contain gluten*), Buffalo Chicken (garlic breadcrumbs), Chicken Pesto Parm (zaatar breadcrumbs), and Rosemary Focaccia. Although some bowls may appear gluten-free at first glance (e.g., Harvest Bowl, Shroomami), the lack of dedicated gluten-free preparation spaces and equipment increases the risk of cross-contamination. The menu doesn't explicitly advertise gluten-free preparation protocols. While the Guacamole Greens bowl appears to be gluten-free based on ingredients alone, cross-contamination remains a significant concern.",
